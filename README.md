 Game Production
 
 This project was developed as part of coursework at University of Central Florida on a team of 6. 
 
 This is a 3D first person game that takes about 1 minute to complete and was developed in the span of 2 weeks. 
 
 On this project, Caden was 1 of 2 programmers. He was responsible for programming player and camera movement, pausing the game, creating a short-ranged punch attack and programming some of the game events such as collecting a key-card to open a doorway. Caden also setup the animation controller for enemy animations. 

Albert was the other main programmer and he was responsible for programming the enemies as well as player health (sanity) and inputs for game controllers. Albert also programmed the collectible prefabs into the game.
